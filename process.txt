THIS DOCUMENT describes the process of creating:
1. actors actresses data

convertiso8859toutf8.sh ./actors.list
# this gives ./actors.list.utf-8
convertiso8859toutf8.sh ./actresses.list

        X ./prunelist.sh "actors"
        X # this gives ./actors.list.utf-8.pru
        X NOPE this is not used. PRU files are not used.

./create_top_billed.sh is the first program after iso is converted to
utf8. it does the pruning for all 3 actor/acrtress and director.
it creates topbilled files.
it should remove the (???? entries.

create_movie_list.sh uses topbilled files create movie.tsv 

create_actor_list.sh uses topbilled to generate actor list .. names.tsv 
which has LN,FN | FN LN | GENDER

  we use second field to map back to name
  Actually, we can take a name and try reversing if no match.
  Robert De Niro -- Niro, Robert De or De Niro, Robert.
  No need to store separately. But we will need ascii form to match.

We only check movies of a director, so we don't need to really keep it
in the database.  we can just do an indexed LOOK of the utf file
pruned. the indexed lookup should store the lowercase name ? so we can
lowercase the incoming name and match easily without case, then look up
byte. also store it in normal form ?
But this way, we cannot sort by year since year is embedded.

aka-titles.tsv :
normalize.rb ./aka-titles.pru gives us aka-titles.tsv
but HOW DO WE GET aka-titles.pru ??
./prune-aka-titles.sh uses utf-8 file, and generates pru
at some stage i moved aka-titles.l to pru, so i may have edited it in
vim
   - remove intro and end, remove till ^======
   - at end remove everything after ^------------
     ok, doesn't seem to be anything after but can't tell for future.
   - remove everything as long as ^" before title. or (aka "
   - remove all with (TV)$ or (TV))<TAB>
   - same for VG and V.
